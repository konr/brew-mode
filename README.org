I want to have a folder with my brewing batches, each in a file. 

I want to be able to write the recipe, make additions along the way and get
intelligent predictions on how the recipe will turn out to be, both
quantitatively (ABV, pH etc) and qualitatively (bitterness, taste profile)

I want to be able to write logs and comment on what happened.

I want to support lots of different beverages, like mead, beer, sake, kombucha,
kefir, etc.

I want to generate schedules of things to do, like staggered-nutrient addition,
dry-hopping, harvesting kombucha etc.

I want to understand ingredients, like the profile of the many hops available.

I want to reason about the whole of my recipes and get suggestions of what to do
next.
